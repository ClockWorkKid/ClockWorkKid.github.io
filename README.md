# PointPillars Model Pruning for Compute Optimization

This work was implemented based on the PointPillars implementation by <a href="https://github.com/zhulf0804/PointPillars">Zhulf0804</a>. Our key contributions lie in the modification of the pointpillars model and the Jupyter notebook files for training model. We have also changed the default 3D object detection split for KITTI dataset and used our own data split for incorporating video data instead of frame by frame training and inference.
